        <p>
          I am a motivated and passionate developer with a strong focus on
          Front-end development. Over the past two years, I have self-studied
          Front-End development, specializing in React.js, and have gained
          extensive knowledge of itâ€™s features and libraries. I am committed to
          continuous learning and am driven by a desire to enhance my skills in
          a professional environment. I am actively seeking opportunities to
          collaborate with innovative companies where I can contribute to
          impactful projects and grow within the industry.
