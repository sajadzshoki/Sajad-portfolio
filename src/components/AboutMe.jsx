              In our school we hade a subject which was about Python . Although
              I have always wanted to learn programming but I didn't take it
              serious for no reason and that one of my biggest REGRETS in my
              life

              After I graduated from high school , I started a youtube channel .
              so I had to learn Editing .<br />
              I learned video editing with Premiere Pro <br />
              and photo editing with Photoshop.
              <br />
              But it wasn't permanent becuse I wanted to start learning
              programming so I didn't have any time for it anymore.

              I put my first steped in programming world with learning C++ basic
              syntax ( for university ) and then Python becuse it was popular
              and different languages to findout my favorite programming field .{" "}
              <br />
              and this progress took me about 6 months Until . . .
