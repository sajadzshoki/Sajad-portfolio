            <p>
              In our school we hade a subject which was about Python . Although
              I have always wanted to learn programming but I didn't take it
              serious for no reason and that is one of my biggest REGRETS in my
              life .

            <p>
              After I graduated from high school , I started a youtube channel .
              so I had to learn Editing .<br />
              I learned video editing with Premiere Pro <br />
              and photo editing with Photoshop.
              <br />
              But it wasn't permanent becuse I wanted to start learning
              programming so I didn't have any time for it anymore .But the good point is now I have quite good editing skills .

            </h1>
            <p>
              I stepped in programming world with learning C++ basic
              syntax ( for university ) and then Python becuse it was popular
              and different languages to findout my favorite programming field .
              <br />
              This progress took me about 6 months Until . . .

              Finally with the help of one my best friends in university I
              started to focuse only on Web Development Front-end . In this time
              i learned
              <span> HTML , CSS , JS , REACTJS , MUI , GIT , GITHUB , ... </span>
              and I'm keep going .
